      <p>Al-Hamdollilah! By the grace of Allah, this organization is serving the 
         poor and the distressed people of our society since 5th May 1999. We are a 
         part of a society where the majority of the people residing in villages and 
         towns are living below the poverty line and even deprived of the basic 
         necessities of life.</p>

      <p>Now let us take a look at the life of the people living in cities, where 
         unfortunately living conditions are not much different. If we examine 
         their family size, we find a very painful situation, where in a small 
         rented house the husband and the wife with their four children survive 
         with a very low earning.</p>

      <p>In today’s world where inflation is at its peak, it is impossible for 
          them to pay for their electricity, children’s education and any medical 
          treatment of any family member.</p>

      <p>How will the head of the family be able to provide for the needs of his 
          children?? The result: he takes loans. He is not to be blamed because 
          he is responsible to provide three meals a day for his family and he is 
          forced to use the wrong means to fulfill his family’s needs.</p>

      <p>Undoubtedly, the poor and the needy are helpless. Our organization spends 
          time with them and is fully aware of their problems and weaknesses. 
          Therefore we want to help them in such a way that all financial aid is 
          free from interest. In view of all the difficulties faced by the poor, 
          Saylani Welfare International Trust has organized 63 different sectors 
          to sort out the problems of the ones who are in need. These departments 
          are efficiently working for the cause of the society.</p>

      <p>By the Grace of the Almighty Allah, it can be proudly said that this 
          organization has become a back-bone of the poor society and provides 
          help after a complete inquiry survey. This organization receives aid 
          from different parts of the world. Each and every penny is spent after 
          a strict inquiry and a utilization report is delivered to those who send 
          this aid to us. In this report, addresses of the people to whom these 
          donations have been given, is mentioned with details. This shows that 
          your money has been given to the right people. You can also contact these 
          people with the help of their addresses and get a confirmation whether the 
          organization has provided them with the aid and if they are really the ones
          who deserve. In a way, your sadaqa or zakaat is being spent with your own 
          hands. Our aim is to inquire and survey to find the ones who need us.
